#RSS agreegator

Build a Backend Server to aggregate data (blog post) from RSS. RSS feed allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format.

Server will add the different RSS feed into a database and will automatically collect all the posts from those feed and download them in the database so that we can read them latter.
